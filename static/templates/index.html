		<h2>How does it work?</h2>
		<div class="entry">
			<p>Create instant, password protected chat rooms without the
			need to signup. Simply click the "Create" button, and share the unique chat URL with your peers.</p>

			<p>
				A room has a lifetime of {{ .Config.RoomAge }} before the first login.
				Up to {{ .Config.MaxPeersPerRoom }} peers can join a room.
				Rooms are automatically deleted after {{ .Config.RoomTimeout }} of inactivity (no messages exchanged).</p>
			<p>
				While in a room, any of the peers can dispose of the room with the click of a button.

			<h2>Why can any connected peer dispose of a room?</h2>
			<p>Niltalk is meant for holding short private conversations between groups of people who have mutually
			agreed to converse. There is no concept of ownership of a room, and introducing ownership complicates
			the otherwise simple privacy feature of instant disposal by any participant. This also means that Niltalk
			isn't really meant for starting conversations by opening up a room to a large number of uninvited participants.</p>
